# Rental History Fix - Icon Download Error Resolution

## Problem Resolved

Error: **Flux component [icon.download] does not exist** - Fixed by removing all download/export functionality as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Download/Export Features

-   ❌ Removed export Excel button from main page
-   ❌ Removed download invoice buttons from detail page
-   ❌ Removed problematic Flux icon components (`icon="download"`, `icon="magnifying-glass"`)

### 2. Files Modified

#### Routes (`routes/web.php`)

-   Removed: `Route::get('/export/excel', ...)`
-   Removed: `Route::get('/{rental}/download-invoice', ...)`
-   Kept: `index`, `show`, `cancel` routes only

#### Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/User/RentalHistoryController.php`)

-   Removed: `downloadInvoice()` method
-   Removed: `export()` method
-   Kept: `index()`, `show()`, `cancel()` methods

#### Service (`app/Services/User/RentalHistoryService.php`)

-   Removed: `generateInvoice()` method
-   Removed: `exportRentalHistory()` method
-   Kept: All core functionality (stats, history, detail, cancel)

#### Views

-   **`index.blade.php`**: Removed export button and fixed icon issues
-   **`show.blade.php`**: Removed both download invoice buttons

### 3. Icon Issues Fixed

-   Replaced `icon="download"` (not available in Flux)
-   Replaced `icon="magnifying-glass"` (not available in Flux)
-   Used button text only instead of problematic icons

### 4. Current Functionality

✅ **Available Features:**

-   View rental history with pagination and filters
-   View detailed rental information
-   Cancel eligible rentals (pending/approved status)
-   Statistics dashboard
-   Responsive design

❌ **Removed Features:**

## Testing Results

-   ✅ Core service methods working properly
-   ✅ Routes cleared and updated
-   ✅ Views rendering without icon errors
-   ✅ No more Flux component errors

## Access URLs (Updated)

-   Main Page: `/user/rental-history`
-   Detail View: `/user/rental-history/{id}`
-   Cancel Rental: `PATCH /user/rental-history/{id}/cancel`

## Notes

-   Application now works purely through web interface
-   No file downloads or exports available

-   Ready for production use without external dependencies
